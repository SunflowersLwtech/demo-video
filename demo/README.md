## What is COUNCIL?

COUNCIL is an AI-powered social deduction game engine that transforms **any document, story, or scenario** into a fully playable experience with autonomous AI characters. Powered by **Mistral AI** for character cognition and **ElevenLabs** for voice synthesis, it creates 5–8 AI agents — each with a unique personality, hidden role, and evolving agenda — that debate, deceive, form alliances, and eliminate each other around a 3D virtual roundtable.

**You join as a hidden player.** The AI characters don't know if you're human or an agent. Can you survive the council?

### The Core Innovation

Most AI games give you a chatbot to talk to. COUNCIL gives you a **society of agents** with **competing hidden agendas** extracted from *your own content*.

> **Upload a PDF** about medieval court intrigue → AI generates Lords, Merchants, and Assassins, each with era-appropriate speech, hidden loyalties, and secret plots.
>
> **Paste a sci-fi excerpt** → Characters become space station crew members hunting a saboteur — voiced by ElevenLabs, animated in 3D, with memories of what every other character has said.
>
> **Pick a built-in scenario** → Jump straight into classic social deduction with pre-designed worlds.

## ✦ The Turing Test Game

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/turing-test.svg" alt="The Turing Test Game — Hidden Human Among AI Agents" width="100%"/>
</div>

COUNCIL is the **reverse Turing test as gameplay**. You don't talk to an AI — you infiltrate a society of AI agents who are trying to figure out if *you* are one of them.

| Dimension | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Hidden Identity** | You are assigned a secret role and faction. AI agents receive the same treatment. Nobody knows who is human. |
| **Behavioral Camouflage** | To survive, you must match the speaking patterns, strategic reasoning, and social behavior of the AI characters. |
| **Social Pressure** | AI agents spontaneously accuse, defend, and form alliances. Your responses are judged against their mental models of "normal" agent behavior. |
| **Asymmetric Information** | You see AI inner thoughts via ThinkingPanel — a window into their reasoning that they don't know you have. |
| **Emergent Dynamics** | With 5–8 independent agents + 1 hidden human, every session produces unique social dynamics, alliances, and betrayals. |

### The 4-Layer Character Prompt Architecture

Every AI character is constructed as a layered system prompt — a psychological model that separates what the character *shows* from what it *knows* and *wants*:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  LAYER 1 — STRATEGIC BRAIN (hidden from all other agents)     ║
║  Hidden role · Faction · Win condition · Behavioral rules     ║
║  "Never reveal your role. Deflect suspicion onto others."     ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  LAYER 2 — CHARACTER HEART (public persona)                   ║
║  Name · Speaking style · Public role                          ║
║  Want: "Gain political power" · Method: "Through manipulation"║
║  Moral values · Decision style · Deep secret                  ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  LAYER 3 — PERSONALITY DNA                                    ║
║  Big Five (O/C/E/A/N) · MBTI type                            ║
║  Sims traits: neat/outgoing/active/playful/nice (25-pt budget)║
║  Mind Mirror (Leary's 4 planes): bio · emotional · mental ·  ║
║  social → Each plane generates unique behavioral "jazz"       ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  LAYER 4 — DYNAMIC STATE + SKILL INJECTIONS                  ║
║  Emotional state: happiness·anger·fear·trust·energy·curiosity ║
║  Memory: STM (10 events) · Episodic (8 summaries) · Semantic ║
║  Relationships: per-character closeness (0-1) + trust (-1,1)  ║
║  + 7 YAML Skill Injections (faction-filtered, priority-sorted)║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Mistral Function Calling in Action

COUNCIL uses Mistral's **function calling API** for the game's most critical structured decisions:

```python
GAME_TOOLS = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "cast_vote",
            "description": "Vote to eliminate a player from the council",
            "parameters": {
                "properties": {
                    "target_id": {"type": "string"},
                    "reasoning": {"type": "string",
                                  "description": "Internal reasoning (hidden from others)"},
                },
                "required": ["target_id", "reasoning"]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "night_action",
            "parameters": {
                "properties": {
                    "action_type": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": ["kill", "investigate", "protect", "save", "poison", "none"]
                    },
                    "target_id": {"type": "string"},
                    "reasoning": {"type": "string"}
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### Anti-Jailbreak Defense

Characters are hardened against prompt injection, personality drift, and AI self-disclosure:

- **Behavioral rules** enforced at Layer 1 of the system prompt
- **Pattern-based filtering**: regex detection of AI-like phrases ("As an AI", "language model", etc.)
- **Canon fact tracking**: characters never contradict their own stated history
- **`_validate_in_character()`** response gating on every generation
- **AI phrase stripping** applied to all output before delivery

### Tension & Complication Engine

The Game Master monitors a continuous tension score and injects narrative complications (Revelation, Time Pressure, Suspicion Shift, Alliance Crack, Evidence) when discussion stalls or consensus forms too quickly. See **[Dynamic Tension Engine](#-dynamic-tension-engine)** for the full breakdown.

---

## ✦ Powered by ElevenLabs

ElevenLabs transforms COUNCIL from a text game into a **cinematic experience**. Characters don't just respond — they speak in distinct voices that carry emotion, accent, and personality.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/voice-pipeline.svg" alt="ElevenLabs Voice Pipeline" width="100%"/>
</div>

### Voice Architecture

| Feature | Implementation | Details |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Text-to-Speech** | ElevenLabs TTS (eleven_v3) | Each character mapped to a unique voice from an 8-voice pool. Real-time streaming via chunked audio. |
| **Emotion Tags** | Automatic injection | 6-axis emotional state → ElevenLabs v3 tags: `[angry]`, `[scared]`, `[excited]`, `[suspicious]`, `[curious]`, `[sighs]` |
| **Speech-to-Text** | ElevenLabs Scribe v2 | Real-time transcription via WebSocket. Single-use tokens. Partial transcript display. Fallback to browser Web Speech API. |
| **Voice Queue** | Custom system | Sequential multi-agent playback. Blob fallback for network instability. |
| **Audio Ducking** | Custom events | BGM fades 0.25→0.08 when characters speak. Phase-aware volumes: night (0.15), discussion (0.25), voting (0.35). |

### Why Emotion Tags Matter

Every character response is analyzed by a 6-dimensional emotional model *before* TTS:

- A character with `fear: 0.8` after being accused → `[scared]` voice delivery
- A Werewolf deflecting with `trust: 0.2` → `[suspicious]` undertone
- A Doctor who saved someone overnight → `[excited]` the next morning

Voice delivery *matches* the character's internal emotional state — no extra LLM call needed.

---

## ✦ Dynamic Tension Engine

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/tension-engine.svg" alt="Dynamic Tension Engine — Adaptive Narrative Complication System" width="100%"/>
</div>

COUNCIL doesn't rely on scripted plot beats. The **Tension Engine** continuously tracks the emotional temperature of the game and dynamically injects narrative complications when discussion stalls, consensus forms too quickly, or a faction is cruising without opposition.

### How Tension Is Calculated

```
tension = f(elimination_ratio, round_progression, recent_kills, vote_splits, silence_duration)
```

| Input Signal | What It Measures | Effect on Tension |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Elimination ratio** | How many players have been removed | Higher ratio → higher baseline |
| **Round progression** | Which round the game is in (R1–R6) | Later rounds → escalating urgency |
| **Recent kills** | Night kills in the last 1–2 rounds | Kills spike tension sharply |
| **Vote splits** | How close the last vote was | Close votes → rising suspicion |
| **Silence duration** | Time since last meaningful exchange | Long silence → triggers complication |

### 5 Complication Types

When tension crosses a threshold — or when discussion stalls — the Game Master injects one of five narrative complications:

| Complication | Trigger | In-Game Effect |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Revelation** | Hidden information surface | "Someone's story doesn't add up — a detail contradicts what was said two rounds ago." |
| **Time Pressure** | Urgency escalation | "The council demands decisive action NOW. No more deliberation." |
| **Suspicion Shift** | Blame redirection | "Eyes turn toward someone who has been suspiciously silent during every accusation." |
| **Alliance Crack** | Trust fractures | "Two allies exchange a tense glance — something unspoken hangs between them." |
| **Evidence** | New clues emerge | "A piece of evidence is discovered that changes everything about the previous vote." |

Complications are **non-repeating within a session** and escalate in intensity as rounds progress. The result: every game follows a rising tension arc, with strategic pressure points that force genuine decision-making.

---

## ✦ Real-Time Streaming

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/realtime-streaming.svg" alt="Real-Time SSE Streaming — 26 Event Types, Zero Polling" width="100%"/>
</div>

COUNCIL uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to deliver every game interaction in real time — word-by-word dialogue, vote-by-vote reveals, and action-by-action night results. Zero polling. Zero request-response delays.

### 26 Event Types Across 4 Categories

| Category | Events | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Dialogue** (8) | `thinking`, `ai_thinking`, `responders`, `stream_start`, `stream_delta`, `stream_end`, `response`, `reaction` | Word-by-word AI character speech with thinking indicators |
| **Voting** (5) | `voting_started`, `vote`, `tally`, `elimination`, `player_eliminated` | Staggered vote reveals with dramatic pacing |
| **Night** (5) | `night_started`, `night_action`, `night_results`, `night_kill_reveal`, `investigation_result` | Secret actions resolved with cinematic reveals |
| **System** (8) | `complication`, `narration`, `discussion_warning`, `discussion_ending`, `game_over`, `last_words`, `error`, `done` | Game flow control and narrative injection |

### Architecture

```

Every character response streams as `stream_delta` events — the frontend accumulates tokens and renders them character-by-character. Vote reveals use timed `vote` events with staggered delays for dramatic tension. Night results arrive as a sequence that builds suspense: `night_started` → `night_action` → `night_results` → `night_kill_reveal`.

## ✦ Multi-Agent System

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/multi-agent.svg" alt="Multi-Agent Character System" width="100%"/>
</div>

### What Makes It a True Multi-Agent System

Unlike chatbot roleplay or single-NPC games, COUNCIL implements genuine multi-agent architecture:

| Property | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| **Independent reasoning** | Each agent has its own system prompt, hidden information, and conversation history |
| **Persistent memory** | 3-tier memory: STM (10 events), Episodic (8 round summaries), Semantic (canon facts) |
| **Relationship tracking** | Per-character `closeness` (0–1) and `trust` (-1 to 1) updated after every interaction |
| **Emotional evolution** | 6-axis emotions (happiness, anger, fear, trust, energy, curiosity) updated via LLM + keyword fallback; decays toward neutral each round |
| **Spontaneous reactions** | 25% per-message probability of unprompted NPC response — organic group dynamics |
| **Strategic privacy** | Hidden voting rationale and night action reasoning never shared with other agents |
| **Dynamic speaking order** | AI-determined per round via `mistral-small-latest` — not fixed turn order |

### The Emotional State System

Emotions flow through the entire pipeline:

```
LLM Analysis (mistral-small) + Keyword Detection
           ↓
   6-Axis Emotional State
   happiness · anger · fear · trust · energy · curiosity
           ↓
    ┌──────┴──────────┬────────────────┬──────────────┐
    ↓                 ↓                ↓              ↓
  System Prompt     ElevenLabs      Character      UI Emoji
  (personality-     Emotion Tags    Roster         Indicators
   modulated)       [angry]         Display        😠😟😊🤨🤔
                    [scared]
                    [excited]
```

---

## ✦ Modular Skills Architecture

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/skills-system.svg" alt="Modular Skills Architecture" width="100%"/>
</div>

COUNCIL implements a **modular cognitive skills system** — 7 YAML-defined skill modules that augment agent intelligence at runtime through dependency-resolved, faction-conditional prompt injection.

### Why Skills Matter

Skills are not static prompts. They are **composable cognitive modules** that:

- **Resolve dependencies** — Deception Mastery automatically pulls in Strategic Reasoning
- **Detect conflicts** — Incompatible skills raise errors before game start
- **Filter by faction** — Evil agents receive *fundamentally different instructions* than Good agents from the same skill module
- **Target specific contexts** — Skills inject into exactly the right prompt (voting, night actions, narration, etc.)
- **Sort by priority** — Lower priority numbers inject first, building foundational reasoning before advanced techniques
- **Cache lazily** — Per-`(skill, target, faction)` tuple, computed once and reused

### The 7 Cognitive Modules

| # | Skill | Priority | Targets | What It Adds |
|---|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Strategic Reasoning** | 10 | character_agent, vote_prompt, night_action | **SSRSR 5-step pipeline**: Situation → Suspicion Map → Reflection → Strategy → Response. Agents internally execute structured pre-response cognition before every reply. |
| 2 | **Contrastive Examples** | 15 | character_agent, vote_prompt | Good/bad behavioral examples via in-context learning. Shows agents what *excellent* vs *poor* play looks like with concrete before/after examples. |
| 3 | **Memory Consolidation** | 20 | character_agent, round_summary | **3-tier memory system**: STM (10 raw events), Episodic (8 compressed round summaries), Semantic (canon facts never contradicted). Cross-round pattern recognition. |
| 4 | **Goal-Driven Behavior** | 25 | character_agent, night_action | **Emotion-goal coupling**: Fear drives survival, curiosity drives investigation, anger drives justice, energy drives influence. Emotional state determines which sub-goal is dominant. |
| 5 | **Deception Mastery** | 30 | character_agent, vote_prompt | **Faction-split injection**: Evil agents learn deflection, alibi building, bus-throwing, controlled information sharing. Good agents learn consistency checking, vote pattern analysis, pressure testing, silence analysis. |
| 6 | **Discussion Dynamics** | 40 | character_agent, spontaneous_reaction | Turn-taking awareness, anti-repetition rules, energy matching, targeted response guidelines. Spontaneous reactions only fire on contradictions, accusations, or genuine surprises. |
| 7 | **Social Evaluation** | 60 | narration | Social dynamics awareness for the Game Master: influence shifts, trust erosion, alliance formation, isolation detection, tension cues woven into atmospheric narration. |

### Faction-Conditional Injection — The Key Innovation

The same skill module produces **fundamentally different agent behavior** based on faction:

<table>
<tr>
<th>🔴 Evil Agent (Deception Mastery)</th>
<th>🔵 Good Agent (Deception Mastery)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Deflection**: When accused, redirect suspicion with specific evidence against someone else

**Alibi Building**: Vote with majority early to build trust capital for later betrayal

**Bus-Throwing**: If an evil ally is about to be exposed, join the accusation to maintain your cover

**Controlled Information**: Share just enough to seem helpful without revealing anything real

</td>
<td>

**Consistency Check**: Track claims across rounds — liars contradict themselves over time

**Vote Pattern Analysis**: Evil players vote together — look for blocs that protect each other

**Pressure Testing**: Direct questions + watch reactions — over-explanation and deflection are tells

**Silence Analysis**: Players quiet during critical moments may be avoiding risk

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### How Skills Inject into the Prompt System

Skills wire into the 5-level `CHARACTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` architecture:

```
Level 1: ABSOLUTE RULES        ← Jailbreak guards
Level 2: STRATEGIC BRAIN       ← Hidden role, faction, win condition
                                  + skill behavioral_rules merged here
Level 3: CHARACTER HEART        ← Public persona, speaking style
Level 4: PERSONALITY DNA        ← Big Five, MBTI, Sims, Mind Mirror
Level 5: DYNAMIC STATE          ← Emotions, memory, relationships
                                  + skill character_agent injections here
         HUMAN-LIKE BEHAVIOR    ← Trait-to-behavior translation
```

The `character_agent` target is the only one embedded in the static system prompt. All other targets (`vote_prompt`, `night_action`, `round_summary`, `spontaneous_reaction`, `narration`) are appended dynamically to the user-turn prompt at the moment of each specific game action.

### 7 Injection Targets

| Target | When It Fires | Used By |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `character_agent` | Every response (static system prompt) | Strategic Reasoning, Contrastive Examples, Memory Consolidation, Goal-Driven, Deception Mastery, Discussion Dynamics |
| `vote_prompt` | Voting decisions | Strategic Reasoning, Contrastive Examples, Deception Mastery |
| `night_action` | Night phase secret actions | Strategic Reasoning, Goal-Driven |
| `round_summary` | End-of-round memory compression | Memory Consolidation |
| `spontaneous_reaction` | Unprompted NPC interjections | Discussion Dynamics |
| `narration` | Game Master flavor text | Social Evaluation |
| `responder_selection` | Reserved for future skills | — |

## ✦ Progressive Disclosure Design

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/progressive-disclosure.svg" alt="Progressive Disclosure Design" width="100%"/>
</div>

COUNCIL separates **public information** from **hidden information** at every layer, creating natural suspense and strategic depth through carefully timed reveals.

### Information Layers

| PUBLIC (visible to all) | HIDDEN (revealed progressively) |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Character name & avatar | Hidden role (Werewolf / Seer / Doctor / Witch) |
| Speaking style & public role | Faction alignment (Good vs. Evil) |
| Observable behavior & statements | Win condition |
| Relationship reputation | Internal voting reasoning |
| Emotional indicators | Night action rationale |
| | AI inner monologue |

### 5 Reveal Moments

| # | Moment | What's Revealed | Who Sees It |
|---|--------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Elimination** | Eliminated character's full hidden profile — role, faction, behavioral rules | All players |
| 2 | **Ghost Mode** | ALL hidden roles + AI inner thoughts for every character | Eliminated player only |
| 3 | **Night Results** | Kill/save/protect outcomes; investigation result | All see outcomes; Seer sees investigation privately |
| 4 | **Game End** | Full scoreboard — every character's role, key events timeline, rounds survived | All players |
| 5 | **ThinkingPanel** | AI character's inner monologue *before* they speak publicly | Human player only (meta-transparency UI) |

## ✦ System Architecture

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/architecture.svg" alt="COUNCIL System Architecture" width="100%"/>
</div>

### Stack Overview

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15 · React 19 · TypeScript | App shell, routing, game state via React Context |
| **3D Scene** | Three.js ~0.175 · React Three Fiber · @react-three/drei | Roundtable scene, animated agent figures, dynamic camera |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS 4 | Responsive UI with phase-themed dark design |
| **Backend** | Python 3.12 · FastAPI | REST + SSE streaming API, async game orchestration |
| **LLM Engine** | Mistral AI SDK | All character cognition, world generation, voting, narration |
| **Voice** | ElevenLabs SDK (eleven_v3 / scribe_v2) | TTS with emotion tags, real-time STT |
| **Session State** | Redis via Upstash (24h TTL) | Hot game state + agent memories, atomic pipeline writes |
| **Analytics DB** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Long-term session storage, fire-and-forget async sync |
| **Validation** | Pydantic v2 | All LLM response parsing with custom validators + retries |

### SSE Streaming Architecture

All game interactions use Server-Sent Events with **26 distinct event types** across 4 categories — zero polling, word-by-word delivery. See **[Real-Time Streaming](#-real-time-streaming)** for the full event catalog and architecture diagram.

### Dual-Layer Persistence

```
Game Action
    │
    ▼
Redis (Upstash) — HOT LAYER
────────────────────────────
• Atomic pipeline: state + all agent memories in one transaction
• 24-hour TTL per session
• Immediate read-back for session recovery
    │
    ▼ (fire-and-forget via asyncio.ensure_future)
Supabase (PostgreSQL) — COLD LAYER
───────────────────────────────────
• game_sessions table upsert
• Long-term analytics
• Does not block game response
```

### 3D Scene Engineering

The Three.js roundtable scene uses careful GPU resource management:

- **No React Strict Mode** — prevents double-mount GPU resource exhaustion
- **No PostProcessing** — eliminates EffectComposer framebuffers
- **No shadows** — removes shadow map allocations
- **No HDRI environment** — eliminates cubemap texture GPU load
- **three.js pinned to ~0.175.0** — compatibility with postprocessing library

Visual atmosphere achieved via `FloatingParticles` (100 fireflies, additive blending), `SciFiFloor` (reflective + concentric grid rings), emissive oscillating materials on agent figures, and 1500-particle `Stars`.

## ✦ Research Foundations

COUNCIL's agent intelligence is grounded in published multi-agent game research:

| Foundation | Application in COUNCIL |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **SSRSR Pipeline** (xuyuzhuang-Werewolf) | Strategic Reasoning skill: Situation → Suspicion → Reflection → Strategy → Response — structured pre-response cognition |
| **Role-Strategy Heuristics** (LLMWereWolf) | Deception Mastery skill: faction-conditional behavioral strategies — evil/good agents receive fundamentally different guidance |
| **Leary's Interpersonal Circumplex** | Mind Mirror personality system: 4 thought planes (bio, emotional, mental, social) generating unique behavioral "jazz" |
| **Sims Personality Model** | 5 traits with 25-point budget (neat/outgoing/active/playful/nice) modulating emotion probabilities and defaults |
| **Big Five + MBTI** | Multi-dimensional personality DNA ensuring diverse, psychologically grounded character behavior |
| **Contrastive Learning** | In-context good/bad behavioral examples teaching agents quality play through demonstration |
